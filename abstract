ABSTRACT: 
This project wants to create and launch an AI
Powered Smart Notice Board to change how 
schools and colleges share information. This 
technology has an impact on message delivery 
speed, making it more helpful and unique. The 
system gets notices from teachers, works on 
them, and shows them on digital screens across 
campus. The system uses natural language 
processing (NLP) and speech recognition to let 
users submit notices by talking. Machine 
learning methods help to study notice patterns 
and make timing and content better. This AI
based answer results in quicker and more 
reliable delivery of key information, bridges 
communication gaps, and adjusts to what the 
school needs. Also, the technology makes it 
simple to translate into many languages, so 
more students can read the notices. It proves 
how AI can make info sharing smoother and 
more central.
